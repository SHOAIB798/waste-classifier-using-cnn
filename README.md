# waste-classifier-using-cnn
classifying waste images as recyclable vs organic waste based on neural network
Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based waste classification model that categorizes waste into different types for better waste management and recycling. The model is trained on an image dataset of various waste categories and can predict the class of new waste images.

Features
Uses CNN for accurate image classification
Supports multiple waste categories (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, organic, etc.)
Implements data preprocessing techniques for improved model performance
Trained using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, if applicable)
Includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix
Dataset
The dataset consists of images categorized into various waste types. It is split into:

Training set: Used to train the model
Validation set: Used to fine-tune the model
Test set: Used to evaluate model performance
Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-classifier.git
cd waste-classifier
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the dataset in the correct directory structure:
dataset/
|-- train/
|   |-- images/
|   |-- labels/
|-- valid/
|   |-- images/
|   |-- labels/
|-- test/
|   |-- images/
|   |-- labels/
Usage
Train the model:
python train.py
Evaluate the model:
python evaluate.py
Make predictions:
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction
Max pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
Fully connected layers for classification
Softmax activation for multi-class classification
Results
After training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test set (replace with actual results). The confusion matrix and classification report can be generated for further analysis.

Future Improvements
Increase dataset size for better generalization
Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models
Optimize hyperparameters to improve accuracy
Deploy the model as a web or mobile applications
